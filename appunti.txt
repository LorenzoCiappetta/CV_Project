TRANSFORMER MODEL:

    CVUSADataset:
        aerial_transform: either use transform.Resize((224, 224)) (match model output), or modify decoder to output 750x750 images (add more upsampling layers, increase computational requirements)

    Model for generating ground truth segmentation maps of aerial images:
        confront performances by choosing different models and parameters
